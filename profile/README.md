## 🚀 Overview

**Photos Search for Mac** transforms how you browse and locate pictures in your macOS Photos library.  
Instead of scrolling endlessly through albums and collections, the app uses advanced indexing and smart queries to help you instantly find the image you’re looking for.  

Key highlights include:  
- Search by file name, date, keyword, or metadata  
- Use AI-powered recognition to find photos by objects, people, or scenes  
- Narrow down large collections with filters like location, device used, or image type  
- Preview results quickly without leaving the search interface  

Whether you’re a casual user trying to locate vacation snapshots, a designer digging up reference materials, or a photographer managing thousands of pictures, Photos Search provides a **fast, accurate, and seamless way** to handle massive photo libraries.  

It integrates directly with macOS Photos and Spotlight, so your workflow feels natural and uninterrupted.

## ℹ️ About

Managing photo collections on modern Macs has become both easier and harder: easier because macOS Photos centralizes all images in one place, but harder because the number of stored images has skyrocketed. Searching by eye alone can waste valuable minutes.  

**Photos Search for Mac** addresses this challenge by delivering a **dedicated photo search utility** that layers intelligent filters, AI object recognition, and metadata indexing on top of your existing Photos library.  

Unlike Spotlight, which is general-purpose, Photos Search is **tailored for visual content**. It allows:  
- Searching with multiple criteria simultaneously (date + keyword + location)  
- Recognizing faces and grouping images by individuals  
- Searching based on EXIF metadata (camera type, aperture, resolution, etc.)  
- Instant previews with the ability to open images directly in editing apps  

This app saves time, boosts productivity, and ensures you never lose track of your most important pictures again.
